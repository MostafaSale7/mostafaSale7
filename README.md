## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer** who enjoys working on systems where **accuracy, reliability, and scale** truly matter — especially in **fintech and payment environments**.

I have hands-on experience across the full lifecycle of backend systems: from understanding business rules, designing databases, building services, to supporting production and handling real incidents. I strongly believe that **good software is simple, maintainable, and trusted**.

I’m calm under pressure, detail-oriented, and I learn best from **real production challenges**.

## 🧠 How I Work & Think

* I prefer **clear, simple designs** over clever or over-engineered solutions
* I focus on **correctness and data integrity**, especially in financial systems
* I treat production systems with **ownership and long-term responsibility**
* I believe real learning comes from **operating and supporting live systems**

---

## 🧭 What I Care About in Software

* Software that behaves **predictably under pressure**
* Systems that are easy to **reason about, debug, and maintain**
* Code written for the **next engineer**, not just the compiler
* Decisions that balance **business needs, technical risk, and operational reality**
* Progress through **consistency**, not bursts of motivation

---

## 💼 Experience Highlights

* Software Engineer with hands-on experience in **fintech and payment systems**
* Strong background in **backend development and database-driven systems**
* Comfortable working with **large-scale data and high-volume transactions**
* Experience across development, production support, and operational environments
* Exposure to **mobile development (iOS)** alongside backend systems
* Familiar with building systems that prioritize **reliability, accuracy, and maintainability**

---

## 🛠 Knowledge & Tools

Rather than chasing tools, I focus on **understanding systems deeply** and using the right technology for the problem.

### Core Strengths

* Backend development with **C# and .NET**
* Database-centric systems using **Oracle PL/SQL** and **SQL Server**
* Designing data flows where **accuracy and consistency** are critical

### Supporting Experience

* **iOS development** (Swift, UIKit) with REST API integration
* File-based systems (CSV, fixed-width formats, control files)
* Working with legacy systems and improving them incrementally

### Engineering Practices

* Writing maintainable, readable code
* Defensive programming in critical paths
* Logging, auditing, and traceability by design
* Understanding production behavior, not just local code
